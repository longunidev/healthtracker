<h1>Insights into Blood Pressure Readings</h1>

<ul>
    <li>
        <h2>Hypotension</h2>
        <p>Hypotension is a medical condition characterized by unusually low blood pressure, typically with a systolic reading below 90 mmHg or a diastolic reading below 60 mmHg. Symptoms may include dizziness, fainting, blurred vision, nausea, and fatigue. Causes may involve dehydration, blood loss, heart issues, endocrine disorders, nervous system disorders, or certain medications. Seek medical advice if experiencing hypotension symptoms.</p>
    </li>
    <li>
        <h2>Normal Ranges</h2>
        <p>The normal blood pressure range is commonly considered to be between 90/60 mmHg and 120/80 mmHg.</p>
    </li>
    <li>
        <h2>Elevated Blood Pressure</h2>
        <p>Elevated blood pressure refers to readings higher than normal but not yet in the high blood pressure range. Specifically, it is defined as a systolic reading between 120-129 mmHg and a diastolic reading below 80 mmHg. Elevated blood pressure serves as a warning sign, indicating an increased risk of developing hypertension. Steps to lower elevated blood pressure include maintaining a healthy weight, regular exercise, reducing salt intake, and limiting alcohol consumption.</p>
    </li>
    <li>
        <h2>Hypertension Stage 1</h2>
        <p>Hypertension Stage 1 denotes the initial stage of high blood pressure. According to the American Heart Association, it is defined as a systolic reading between 130 and 139 mmHg or a diastolic reading between 80 and 89 mmHg.</p>
    </li>
    <li>
        <h2>Hypertension Stage 2</h2>
        <p>Hypertension Stage 2 represents a more severe form of high blood pressure, characterized by a systolic reading of 140 mmHg or higher, or a diastolic reading of 90 mmHg or higher. In this stage, systolic pressure is generally above 160 mmHg, and diastolic pressure is typically over 100 mmHg.</p>
    </li>
    <li>
        <h2>Hypertension Crisis</h2>
        <p>A hypertension crisis is identified by a systolic pressure exceeding 180 mmHg and/or a diastolic pressure surpassing 120 mmHg.</p>
    </li>
