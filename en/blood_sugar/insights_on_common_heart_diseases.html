    <h1>Common Heart Diseases Unveiled</h1>

    <ul>
        <li>
            <h2>Congenital Heart Disease</h2>
            <p>Congenital heart disease, also referred to as congenital heart defect, is a heart condition present at
                birth. Various types include atypical heart valves, septal defects, and atresia. Some cases may go
                undiagnosed as they may not display noticeable symptoms.</p>
        </li>

        <li>
            <h2>Coronary Artery Disease (CAD)</h2>
            <p>Coronary artery disease stands out as the most prevalent heart condition. Individuals with CAD experience
                narrow or blocked coronary arteries, potentially leading to chest pain, heart attacks, or strokes.
                Atherosclerosis, commonly known as hardening of the arteries, primarily causes CAD by reducing blood
                flow and limiting the supply of oxygen and nutrients to the heart.</p>
        </li>

        <li>
            <h2>Arrhythmia (Abnormal Heart Rhythms)</h2>
            <p>Arrhythmia occurs when the heart muscle struggles to regulate electrical impulses effectively, resulting
                in rapid (tachycardia), slow (bradycardia), or irregular heartbeats (atrial fibrillation).</p>
        </li>

        <li>
            <h2>Heart Valve Disease</h2>
            <p>Heart valve disease arises when one or more heart valves fail to open and close properly, disrupting the
                blood flow. This condition may be present at birth or caused by factors such as high blood pressure,
                CAD, heart infections, or a heart attack.</p>
        </li>

        <li>
            <h2>Dilated Cardiomyopathy</h2>
            <p>Dilated cardiomyopathy is a condition where the heart muscle becomes stretched, thickened, or stiff.
                Without proper treatment, the heart weakens over time, potentially leading to arrhythmia, blood clots,
                and heart failure. This condition is more prevalent among individuals aged 20 to 60, as reported by the
                American Heart Association.</p>
        </li>

        <li>
            <h2>Pericardial Disease</h2>
            <p>The pericardium, consisting of the visceral and parietal layers with a middle fluid layer, can be
                affected by pericardial disease. Pericarditis, inflammation of the pericardium, is a common condition,
                particularly observed in individuals undergoing open-heart surgery.</p>
        </li>

        <li>
            <h2>Heart Failure</h2>
            <p>Heart failure occurs when the heart cannot effectively pump blood to meet the body's needs. Causes
                include untreated coronary artery disease, high blood pressure, and arrhythmias. Early treatment and
                lifestyle changes are crucial to manage heart failure, as it is not curable.</p>
        </li>
