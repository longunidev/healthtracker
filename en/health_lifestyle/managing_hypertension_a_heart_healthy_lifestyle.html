    <h1>Managing Hypertension: A Heart-Healthy Lifestyle</h1>
    <ul>
      <li>
        <p>
          Lowering blood pressure requires consistent effort and a commitment to
          a heart-healthy lifestyle. Beyond medications, making changes in your
          daily habits can significantly contribute to reducing hypertension.
          Explore the following heart-healthy practices to bring your blood
          pressure back to optimal levels and enhance your overall well-being.
        </p>
      </li>

      <li>
        <h2>1. Maintain a Healthy Weight</h2>
        <p>
          Weight and blood pressure are closely linked. Losing excess weight can
          expand blood vessels, making the heart more efficient in pumping
          blood. Research suggests that even a modest weight loss of 5% of your
          body weight can lead to a noticeable reduction in blood pressure.
        </p>

        <p>
          Pay attention to your waistline, as excess abdominal fat can impact
          blood pressure. Men should aim for a waist measurement of less than 40
          inches, while women should strive for no more than 35 inches.
        </p>
      </li>

      <li>
        <h2>2. Follow a DASH Diet</h2>
        <p>
          The Dietary Approaches to Stop Hypertension (DASH) diet is designed to
          prevent and treat high blood pressure. It emphasizes a balanced intake
          of fruits, vegetables, whole grains, lean meats, and low-fat dairy
          products. By reducing sodium intake and increasing potassium,
          magnesium, and calcium, the DASH diet can significantly lower systolic
          blood pressure.
        </p>

        <p>
          When shopping for food, check labels to ensure sodium content is 5% or
          less. Avoid items with over 20% sodium.
        </p>
      </li>

      <li>
        <h2>3. Limit Alcohol Consumption</h2>
        <p>
          Excessive alcohol consumption is linked to 16% of hypertension cases
          worldwide. Drinking more than moderate levels can raise blood
          pressure. Men should limit alcohol intake to no more than two drinks a
          day, and women should restrict it to one drink a day. If on
          hypertensive medications, it's advisable to avoid alcohol, as it can
          decrease their effectiveness.
        </p>
      </li>

      <li>
        <h2>4. Exercise Regularly</h2>
        <p>
          Regular exercise strengthens the heart, reduces blood pressure, and
          contributes to overall well-being. Aim for 150 minutes of
          moderate-intensity aerobic workouts, strength training, and
          flexibility exercises each week. Consistency is key to maintaining the
          positive effects on blood pressure.
        </p>
      </li>

      <li>
        <h2>5. Manage Stress</h2>
        <p>
          Chronic stress can elevate heart rate and constrict blood vessels,
          contributing to hypertension. Effective stress management involves
          problem-solving, self-care, and avoiding negative habits like
          excessive alcohol consumption and smoking.
        </p>
      </li>

      <li>
        <h2>6. Quit Smoking</h2>
        <p>
          Smoking immediately increases blood pressure and damages blood vessels
          over time. Nicotine in cigarettes can also interfere with the
          effectiveness of medications. Quitting smoking is a crucial step
          toward better heart health and hypertension management.
        </p>
      </li>

      <li>
        <h2>7. Engage in Regular Physical Activity</h2>
        <p>
          Regular exercise is a powerful tool for managing hypertension. Both
          aerobic exercises and strength training contribute to better
          cardiovascular health. Aim for at least 150 minutes of
          moderate-intensity exercise per week, incorporating activities that
          you enjoy.
        </p>

        <p>
          Consistency is key, so find activities that fit your lifestyle and
          make them a regular part of your routine.
        </p>
      </li>

      <li>
        <h2>8. Embrace Heart-Healthy Habits</h2>
        <p>
          Adopting heart-healthy habits further contributes to overall
          cardiovascular well-being. Limit alcohol consumption, quit smoking,
          and ensure quality sleep each night. These lifestyle choices support
          blood pressure control and promote long-term heart health.
        </p>

        <p>
          Consult with healthcare professionals for personalized advice based on
          your unique health profile and needs.
        </p>
      </li>

      <li>
        <h2>9. Prioritize Potassium-Rich Foods</h2>
        <p>
          Increase your intake of potassium, a mineral known for its blood
          pressure-lowering effects. Potassium helps counterbalance the sodium
          in your diet and promotes proper muscle and nerve function.
        </p>

        <p>
          Include potassium-rich foods such as bananas, oranges, spinach, and
          sweet potatoes in your daily meals.
        </p>
      </li>

      <li>
        <p>
          By incorporating these heart-healthy practices into your lifestyle,
          you can actively contribute to managing hypertension and improving
          your overall health. Consult with healthcare professionals for
          personalized guidance tailored to your specific needs.
