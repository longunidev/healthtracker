    <h1>Nutrition Essentials</h1>

    <ul>

        <li>
            <p>Your dietary choices significantly impact your energy levels, physical appearance, and overall
                well-being.
                Understanding the essential components of nutrition is crucial for making informed decisions about what
                you
                eat.
                Let's delve into the basics of macronutrients and micronutrients to guide you on a path to healthier
                eating.
            </p>

        </li>

        <li>

            <h2>Macronutrients</h2>

            <p>Macronutrients, comprising carbohydrates, proteins, and fats, serve as the fundamental building blocks of
                your
                diet, providing the necessary fuel for your body's functions.</p>

            <ul class="normal-ul">
                <li>
                    <h3>1. Carbohydrates</h3>
                    <p>Carbohydrates supply glucose for vital bodily functions. There are three types: simple or refined
                        carbs,
                        complex starchy carbs, and complex fibrous carbs. Sources include bread, beans, milk, potatoes,
                        and
                        cookies.</p>
                </li>

                <li>
                    <h3>2. Proteins</h3>
                    <p>Proteins, composed of amino acids, contribute to tissue structure and play a vital role in muscle
                        development, skin maintenance, and wound healing. Animal products like meat and eggs are rich
                        protein
                        sources.</p>
                </li>

                <li>
                    <h3>3. Fats</h3>
                    <p>Fats are essential for energy storage, organ protection, and various bodily functions. Saturated
                        fats
                        and
                        unsaturated fats are the main types. Sources include vegetable oil, nuts, seeds, coconut, and
                        coconut
                        oil. It's recommended that fats should comprise 20% to 35% of daily energy intake.</p>
                </li>
            </ul>

        </li>

        <li>

            <h2>Micronutrients</h2>

            <p>Micronutrients, required in smaller quantities, are equally vital for overall health. Essential vitamins
                and
                minerals fall into two categories: water-soluble and fat-soluble.</p>

            <ul class="normal-ul">
                <li>
                    <h3>1. Water-soluble vitamins</h3>
                    <p>These vitamins dissolve in water and include B vitamins and vitamin C. They play a crucial role
                        in
                        energy
                        production and cell strengthening. Sources include eggs, organ meats, milk, fish, and citrus
                        fruits.
                    </p>
                </li>

                <li>
                    <h3>2. Fat-soluble vitamins</h3>
                    <p>Vitamins A, D, E, and K, which do not dissolve in water but in fat, contribute to eye, bone, and
                        cell
                        health. Sources include liver, beef, fish, kale, sweet potatoes, and egg yolks.</p>
                </li>

                <li>
                    <h3>3. Macrominerals</h3>
                    <p>These minerals, needed in larger amounts, include calcium, phosphorus, magnesium, sodium,
                        potassium,
                        chloride, and sulfur. They are crucial for fluid balance, nerve transmission, muscle
                        contraction,
                        and
                        overall bodily functions. Sources include table salt, processed foods, milk, fish, and nuts.</p>
                </li>

                <li>
                    <h3>4. Trace minerals</h3>
                    <p>Required in smaller amounts, trace minerals like iron, manganese, copper, iodine, zinc, cobalt,
                        fluoride,
                        and selenium play roles in energy metabolism and blood sugar regulation. They are found in
                        meats,
                        seafood, grains, vegetables, and whole grains.</p>
                </li>
            </ul>
        </li>

        <li>

            <p>Understanding these nutritional components empowers you to make informed choices, ensuring your body
                receives
                the
                essential nutrients it needs for optimal health.</p>
        </li>
