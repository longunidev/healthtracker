    <h1>Heart Rate Zones of Children</h1>

    <ul>
        <li>
            <h2>Introduction</h2>
            <p>After knowing their THR (Target Heart Rate) and RHR (Resting Heart Rate) ranges, many parents wish to
                know whether their children's pulse or heart rate zone can be different or not. The truth is that
                children may have a higher heart rate than adults. Let's read on to know more.</p>
        </li>
        <li>
            <h2>Resting Heart Rate Zone</h2>
            <p>It has been proved that children's heart size is smaller and their stroke and blood volume are lower than
                adults'. Therefore, their resting heart rate zone usually is higher than that of adults.</p>
            <p>What needs to be mentioned is that although adult men and women can have different heart rate ranges, the
                maximum heart rate difference during a young age and adolescence between boys and girls is very small.
                The actual heart rate varies by child and is likely genetically determined.</p>
        </li>
        <li>
            <h2>Healthy Resting Heart Rate Ranges</h2>
            <ul>
                <li>Newborns (ages 0 to 1 month): 70 to 190 beats per minute</li>
                <li>Infants (ages 1 to 11 months): 80 to 160 beats per minute</li>
                <li>Children (ages 1 to 2 years): 80 to 130 beats per minute</li>
                <li>Children (ages 3 to 4 years): 80 to 120 beats per minute</li>
                <li>Children (ages 5 to 6 years): 75 to 115 beats per minute</li>
                <li>Children (ages 7 to 9 years): 70 to 110 beats per minute</li>
                <li>Children (ages 10 to 15 years): 70 to 100 beats per minute</li>
                <li>Children (over 15 years old): 60 to 100 beats per minute</li>
            </ul>
        </li>
        <li>
            <h2>Healthy Target Heart Rate</h2>
            <p>Your child's target heart rate is decided by maximum heart rate. The actual heart rate varies by child.
                It is healthy for your child to exercise with a heart rate between 50% to 85% of his or her maximum
                heart rate.</p>
            <p>Also, to save your time, you can use our app to check the RHR and THR of your child. We provide both
                children's RHR measurement and THR automatic calculation to cater to your needs and help you take care
                of your child better.</p>
