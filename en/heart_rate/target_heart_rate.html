    <h1>Target Heart Rate</h1>

    <ul>
        <li>
            <h2>Introduction</h2>
            <p>Target heart rate (THR or training heart rate) is the suggested range of how often your heart beats
                during exercise for improving health. It is an important index for you to exercise safely.</p>
        </li>
        <li>
            <h2>Calculating Maximum Heart Rate</h2>
            <p>Your THR depends on the highest number of times your heart can beat in one minute, which is your maximum
                heart rate. For men, the estimated maximum heart rate can be calculated as 220 minus their age. For
                women, the Northwestern Medicine research suggests using the equation HRmax = 206 - (0.88 x your age) to
                get an accurate result.</p>
        </li>
        <li>
            <h2>Target Heart Rate Zones</h2>
            <p>If you are doing moderate-intensity activity, your THR should be between 50% to 70% of your maximum heart
                rate. For vigorous exercise, your THR should be between 70% to 85% of your maximum heart rate.</p>
            <p>For example, a 40-year-old man's maximum heart rate is 180 (220 - 40). The THR should be 50% to 85% of
                180, in other words, 90 to 153 beats per minute.</p>
        </li>
        <li>
            <h2>Using the App for Accuracy</h2>
            <p>If you are training to burn body fat or improve your cardiovascular health, you can use our app to get
                more accurate and scientific THR automatically. Simply input your age and gender, specify your activity
                level (warm-up, moderate training, high-intensity training, or extremely vigorous workout), and the app
                will provide you with the appropriate target heart rate.</p>
            <p>This eliminates the need for manual calculations and ensures precision in determining your THR.</p>
        </li>
    </ul>
