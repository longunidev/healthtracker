    <h1>Resting Heart Rate</h1>

    <ul>
        <li>
            <h2>Introduction</h2>
            <p>If you wish to know your current or future heart health condition, resting heart rate (RHR) is an
                important indicator you must know.</p>
        </li>
        <li>
            <h2>Importance of RHR</h2>
            <p>As everyone knows, the heart pumps blood and oxygen throughout the body to keep it functioning well. The
                RHR is the number of heart beats per minute while you're at rest, showing whether your heart muscle is
                functioning well or not.</p>
            <p>People with healthy hearts usually have RHR between 60 and 100 beats per minute. Irregularities, or
                values lower than 60 or higher than 100 per minute, may indicate potential heart problems that should be
                brought to the attention of you and your doctor.</p>
        </li>
        <li>
            <h2>Measuring RHR</h2>
            <p>To measure your RHR, find a time when you are at rest, put your index and middle finger on the thumb side
                of your wrist or on either side of your neck to feel the pulse. Count how many times it beats in 30
                seconds and double the number to calculate your RHR per minute.</p>
            <p>An alternative is to use our app, which only requires showing one of your fingertips under your mobile
                camera to calculate your RHR.</p>
        </li>
        <li>
            <h2>Ensuring Accuracy</h2>
            <p>To ensure accuracy and identify irregularities, it is recommended to measure your RHR multiple times
                throughout the day or week and calculate an average number.</p>
            <p>Your RHR may change throughout the day due to environmental factors, activity levels, measurement timing,
                etc.</p>
        </li>
        <li>
            <h2>Best Practices</h2>
            <p>For the most accurate results, the American Heart Association recommends checking your RHR in the morning
                after a night's sleep and before getting out of bed. Additionally, wait for at least one to two hours
                after consuming caffeine, exercising, or experiencing a stressful situation.</p>
        </li>
    </ul>
