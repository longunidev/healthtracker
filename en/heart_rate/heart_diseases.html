    <h1>Heart Diseases</h1>

    <ul>
        <li>
            <h2>Overview</h2>
            <p>Heart disease encompasses several types of heart conditions, collectively known as cardiovascular
                diseases. These conditions affect the heart and blood vessels in various ways.</p>
        </li>
        <li>
            <h2>Congenital Heart Disease</h2>
            <p>A type of heart condition present at birth, congenital heart disease includes abnormalities such as
                atresia, septal abnormalities, and atypical heart valves. Some congenital cardiac abnormalities may not
                show symptoms and could go undetected.</p>
        </li>
        <li>
            <h2>Coronary Artery Disease (CAD)</h2>
            <p>The most prevalent cardiac illness, CAD causes narrow or obstructed coronary arteries, leading to chest
                pain, heart attacks, or strokes. Atherosclerosis, or hardening of the arteries, is a common cause
                affecting blood flow and oxygen/nutrient supply to the heart.</p>
        </li>
        <li>
            <h2>Arrhythmia (Abnormal Heart Rhythms)</h2>
            <p>An arrhythmia occurs when the heart's muscle cannot control internal electrical impulses, resulting in
                excessively fast, slow, or irregular heartbeats. While most arrhythmias are harmless, some may cause
                symptoms requiring immediate medical attention.</p>
        </li>
        <li>
            <h2>Heart Valve Disease</h2>
            <p>Heart valve disease occurs when one or more heart valves fail to open and close properly, affecting blood
                flow. It can be inherited or caused by factors like high blood pressure, CAD, heart infections, or heart
                attacks.</p>
        </li>
        <li>
            <h2>Dilated Cardiomyopathy</h2>
            <p>In dilated cardiomyopathy, the heart muscle becomes strained, thickened, or stiff, leading to issues like
                arrhythmia, blood clots, and heart failure. This condition typically affects individuals between the
                ages of 20 and 60.</p>
        </li>
        <li>
            <h2>Pericardial Disease</h2>
            <p>Pericardial disease refers to conditions affecting the pericardium, including pericarditis
                (inflammation). Pericarditis can occur in patients who have had open-heart surgery.</p>
        </li>
        <li>
            <h2>Heart Failure</h2>
            <p>Heart failure occurs when the heart cannot efficiently pump blood to meet the body's demands. Causes
                include untreated CAD, high blood pressure, and arrhythmias. Early treatment and lifestyle modifications
                are crucial as heart failure cannot be cured once diagnosed.</p>
        </li>
        <li>
            <h2>Prevention and Management</h2>
            <p>Various conditions, including hypertension, diabetes, coronary disease, and infections, can aggravate
                heart disease. Regular heart screening programs are recommended for early diagnosis and management.
                Consult a heart specialist for personalized advice based on screening results.</p>
        </li>
    </ul>
