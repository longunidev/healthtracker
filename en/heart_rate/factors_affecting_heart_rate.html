    <h1>Factors Affecting Heart Rate</h1>

    <ul>
        <li>
            <h2>Temperature</h2>
            <p>The change in air or body temperature can influence your heart rate. Extreme temperatures, either too
                cold or too hot, can cause a slight increase in heart rate, usually 5 to 10 beats per minute. High
                humidity can also contribute to an elevated heart rate.</p>
        </li>
        <li>
            <h2>Body Position</h2>
            <p>Your heart rate typically remains stable with different body positions. However, a sudden change, such as
                standing up, can lead to a temporary increase in heart rate for the first 15 to 20 seconds.</p>
        </li>
        <li>
            <h2>Emotions</h2>
            <p>Intense emotions and stressful situations can lead to an elevated heart rate.</p>
        </li>
        <li>
            <h2>Body Size</h2>
            <p>Individuals with severe obesity may experience a slightly faster pulse, generally not exceeding 100 beats
                per minute.</p>
        </li>
        <li>
            <h2>Caffeine and Nicotine</h2>
            <p>Caffeine-containing beverages and nicotine can raise your heart rate. The peak effect of caffeine on
                heart rate occurs within one hour and lasts for 4 to 6 hours.</p>
        </li>
        <li>
            <h2>Alcohol</h2>
            <p>Consuming more than five alcoholic beverages for men or four for women within two hours can lead to an
                irregular and rapid heart rate.</p>
        </li>
        <li>
            <h2>Saturated Fat and Sodium</h2>
            <p>Excessive sodium intake can prompt an increase in heart rate as the heart pumps more blood to dilute it.
                Saturated fat consumption can raise cholesterol levels, potentially affecting heart activities and
                increasing heart rate.</p>
        </li>
        <li>
            <h2>Medications</h2>
            <p>Beta blockers may result in a slow heart rate, while an excess of thyroid hormone can cause the heart to
                beat harder and faster, potentially triggering abnormal rhythms.</p>
        </li>
        <li>
            <h2>Age</h2>
            <p>As you age, your resting heart rate (RHR) may not change significantly, but your training heart rate
                (THR) may become slower.</p>
        </li>
        <li>
            <h2>Gender</h2>
            <p>The average resting heart rate is higher in women than in men. However, women generally have a lower risk
                of cardiac diseases.</p>
        </li>
        <li>
            <h2>Exercise</h2>
            <p>Regular exercise gradually lowers your resting heart rate and reduces the risk of death associated with a
                high resting heart rate.</p>
        </li>
    </ul>
