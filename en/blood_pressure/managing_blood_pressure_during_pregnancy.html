<h1>Guidelines for Blood Pressure Management Throughout Pregnancy</h1>

<ul>
    <li>
        <h2>Before Pregnancy</h2>
        <p>Before conceiving, it is essential to develop a pregnancy strategy. Consult with your healthcare professional about any health issues or medications you are taking. They can guide you on safe medications during pregnancy and provide advice on maintaining a healthy weight through proper nutrition and regular physical activity.</p>
    </li>
    <li>
        <h2>During Pregnancy</h2>
        <p>Initiate prenatal care promptly and attend all scheduled appointments. Communicate with your healthcare provider about your medications and their safety during pregnancy. Monitor blood pressure at home using a personal device, promptly notifying your healthcare provider of any concerns. Focus on maintaining a healthy diet and weight to support a successful pregnancy.</p>
    </li>
    <li>
        <h2>After Pregnancy</h2>
        <p>Post-pregnancy, refrain from smoking, which elevates blood pressure and increases the risk of heart-related issues. If you smoke, reducing or quitting will significantly lower your risk for heart disease. Prioritize a smoke-free environment for both your well-being and that of your newborn.</p>
        <p>Additionally, continue the practices learned during pregnancy, such as maintaining a healthy lifestyle, to promote long-term cardiovascular health.</p>
    </li>
    <li>
        <h2>Additional Tips</h2>
        <p>1. Engage in low-impact exercises suitable for pregnant women to promote physical well-being.</p>
        <p>2. Include a variety of nutrient-rich foods in your diet to ensure optimal health for both mother and baby.</p>
        <p>3. Stay hydrated by consuming an adequate amount of water throughout the day.</p>
    </li>
</ul>
