<h1>Types of High Blood Pressure Conditions During Pregnancy</h1>

<ul>
    <li>
        <h2>Chronic Hypertension</h2>
        <p>Chronic hypertension refers to elevated blood pressure either before pregnancy or within the first 20 weeks. Women with chronic hypertension may also be at risk of developing preeclampsia later in pregnancy.</p>
    </li>
    <li>
        <h2>Gestational Hypertension</h2>
        <p>Gestational hypertension occurs when high blood pressure manifests solely during pregnancy, without proteinuria or other cardiac or renal issues. Typically diagnosed after 20 weeks, it usually resolves after childbirth. However, some women with gestational hypertension face an increased risk of developing chronic hypertension in the future.</p>
    </li>
    <li>
        <h2>Preeclampsia/Eclampsia</h2>
        <p>Preeclampsia emerges when a woman with previously normal blood pressure experiences a sudden increase along with proteinuria or other complications after 20 weeks of pregnancy. It occurs in about 1 in 25 pregnancies in the United States. Severe cases may lead to eclampsia, a medical emergency with symptoms like incessant headaches, altered vision, abdominal pain, nausea, swelling, weight gain, and breathing difficulties.</p>
        <p>Additional symptoms may include:</p>

        </ul>
    </li>

        <h2>Managing High Blood Pressure During Pregnancy</h2>
        <p>Regular prenatal check-ups are crucial for monitoring blood pressure. Maintaining a well-balanced diet, staying hydrated, and engaging in appropriate physical activity can contribute to a healthier pregnancy.</p>
