    <h1>Recognizing Symptoms of Hypertension</h1>

    <ul>
      <li>
        <h2>Severe Headache</h2>
        <p>
          If hypertension leads to increased pressure in brain blood vessels, it
          may result in severe headaches, indicating a medical emergency.
          Damaged blood vessels in the brain can lead to throbbing headaches
          worsening with slight activity.
        </p>
      </li>
      <li>
        <h2>Dizziness</h2>
        <p>
          Dizziness should not be dismissed, as persistent high blood pressure
          is a major contributor to stroke. Sudden dizziness, difficulty
          maintaining balance, and an unsteady gait may indicate an imminent
          stroke.
        </p>
      </li>
      <li>
        <h2>Nausea</h2>
        <p>
          Episodes of sudden nausea and loss of appetite in individuals with
          hypertension may signify a hypertensive crisis. Nausea, often
          accompanied by dizziness, can indicate extremely high blood pressure.
        </p>
      </li>
      <li>
        <h2>Difficulty of Breath</h2>
        <p>
          Elevated blood pressure can impact heart and lung function, resulting
          in symptoms such as shortness of breath, especially during physical
          activity or exercise.
        </p>
      </li>
      <li>
        <h2>Chest Pain</h2>
        <p>
          Hypertension is a significant risk factor for heart attack and heart
          failure. Arteries hardening due to high blood pressure can lead to
          reduced blood supply to the heart, causing chest pain (angina).
        </p>
      </li>
      <li>
        <h2>Blurred Vision or Other Vision Changes</h2>
        <p>
          Extremely high blood pressure can damage blood vessels in the eyes,
          causing symptoms like blurred vision or, in severe cases, vision loss.
        </p>
      </li>
      <li>
        <h2>Nosebleeds</h2>
        <p>
          While nosebleeds are not typical for hypertension, extreme blood
          pressure levels can lead to vessel damage in the nose, resulting in
          bleeding. Immediate medical attention is necessary in such cases.
        </p>
      </li>
      <li>
        <h2>Additional Information</h2>
        <p>
          Regular monitoring of blood pressure, a balanced diet, and a healthy
          lifestyle are essential for managing hypertension and preventing
          associated complications.
        </p>
