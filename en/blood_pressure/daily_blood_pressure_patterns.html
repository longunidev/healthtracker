    <ul>
        <li>
            <h2>Introduction to Blood Pressure</h2>
            <p>Blood pressure reflects the force on blood vessel walls during heart contraction and relaxation,
                providing a crucial health indicator.</p>
        </li>
        <li>
            <h2>Lower Blood Pressure in the Morning</h2>
            <p>Morning blood pressure tends to be lower as the body is in a resting state during sleep, leading to
                decreased heart rate and blood pressure.</p>
        </li>
        <li>
            <h2>Fluctuations During the Day</h2>
            <p>Throughout the day, blood pressure is influenced by factors like emotions, diet, and exercise, causing
                fluctuations.</p>
        </li>
        <li>
            <h2>Rising Blood Pressure at Night</h2>
            <p>Nighttime sees a gradual rise in blood pressure as the body transitions to a waking state, preparing for
                activity.</p>
        </li>
        <li>
            <h2>Blood Pressure Drop During Sleep</h2>
            <p>During deep sleep, blood pressure reaches its lowest point, signifying a state of complete relaxation for
                the heart and blood vessels.</p>
        </li>
        <li>
            <h2>Long-Term Blood Pressure Changes</h2>
