<h1>Effective Strategies to Decrease and Prevent High Blood Pressure</h1>

<ul>
    <li>
        <h2>Maintain a Healthy Weight</h2>
        <p>Being overweight or obese can increase the risk of high blood pressure. Achieve and maintain a healthy weight through a balanced diet and regular exercise.</p>
    </li>
    <li>
        <h2>Exercise Regularly</h2>
        <p>Engage in regular physical activity to help lower blood pressure and enhance overall health. Aim for at least 150 minutes of moderate-intensity exercise per week.</p>
    </li>
    <li>
        <h2>Eat a Healthy Diet</h2>
        <p>Adopt a diet rich in fruits, vegetables, whole grains, and lean proteins. Limit salt, saturated fats, and added sugars to support lower blood pressure.</p>

    <li>
        <h2>Get Enough Sleep</h2>

    </li>
    <li>
        <h2>Reduce Stress</h2>
