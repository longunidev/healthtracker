<h1>Risks and Implications of High Blood Pressure in Teens</h1>

<ul>
    <li>
        <h2>Alarming Trends in Teen Health</h2>
        <p>Over the period from 2001 to 2016, there was a decrease in the prevalence of high blood pressure among teens according to both old and new criteria. However, a significant number of young individuals still face high blood pressure and associated cardiovascular risk factors like diabetes and obesity. The new criteria reveal that more teens are now classified with high blood pressure compared to 15 years ago using the old criteria.</p>
    </li>
    <li>
        <h2>New Guidelines and Statistics</h2>
        <p>The updated guidelines now categorize around 2.6% of U.S. youths, nearly 800,000 individuals, as having high blood pressure. Almost half of these reclassified youths are dealing with obesity, identified by a body mass index (BMI) equal to or exceeding the 95th percentile. Notably, teens aged 18 to 19 contribute significantly to this rise, with males constituting over two-thirds of the increase.</p>

        <h2>Persisting Risks into Adulthood</h2>
        <p>Teens exhibiting risk factors like hypertension, obesity, and diabetes are likely to carry these risks into adulthood. This prolonged exposure puts them at an elevated risk for heart disease and stroke.</p>
    </li>
    <li>
        <h2>Healthy Habits for Teen Cardiovascular Health</h2>
        <p>Maintaining a healthy diet and engaging in regular exercise play crucial roles in reducing these risk factors. Emphasizing these lifestyle habits during adolescence is essential for preventing cardiovascular diseases in later stages of life.</p>
    </li>
    <li>
        <h2>Broader Perspectives on Teen Health</h2>
        <p>Understanding the dynamics of blood pressure trends in teens requires a holistic approach. Factors such as socioeconomic influences, educational initiatives, and community support are pivotal in crafting effective strategies for teenage cardiovascular health.</p>
