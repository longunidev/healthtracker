<ul>
    <li>
        <h2>Hypotensive Drugs Mechanism</h2>
        <p>Hypotensive drugs, also known as anti-hypertensive drugs, are designed to lower high blood pressure. These medications work by various methods, including relaxing blood vessels, reducing fluid volume, or decreasing heart activity.</p>

        <h2>Benefits of Hypotensive Drugs</h2>
        <p>The advantages of hypotensive drugs extend to reducing the risk of heart attacks, strokes, and other cardiovascular diseases. Lowering blood pressure also helps prevent organ damage, such as to the kidneys and eyes, associated with high blood pressure.</p>

        <p>It is crucial to use hypotensive drugs under healthcare professional supervision, as they may interact with other medications and might not be suitable for everyone. Additionally, adjustments may be needed over time based on changing blood pressure or evolving health conditions.</p>
        <p>Common types of hypotensive drugs include diuretics, ACE inhibitors, angiotensin II receptor blockers, beta blockers, calcium channel blockers, and renin inhibitors. Each type has unique mechanisms, benefits, and risks tailored to individual patient needs and health status.</p>
