<h1>Understanding Factors that Affect Blood Pressure</h1>

<ul>
    <li>
        <h2>Age</h2>
        <p>As individuals age, their blood vessels tend to become stiffer and less elastic, contributing to an increase in blood pressure.</p>
    </li>
    <li>
        <h2>Family History</h2>
        <p>If there is a family history of high blood pressure, the risk of developing this condition is higher.</p>
    </li>
    <li>
        <h2>Obesity</h2>
        <p>Being overweight or obese can exert additional strain on the heart and elevate the risk of high blood pressure.</p>
    </li>
    <li>
        <h2>Physical Inactivity</h2>
        <p>A lack of regular physical activity can lead to weight gain, increasing the risk of high blood pressure.</p>
    </li>
    <li>
        <h2>Smoking</h2>
        <p>Smoking can damage blood vessels, raising the risk of developing high blood pressure.</p>
    </li>
    <li>
        <h2>Stress</h2>
        <p>Chronic stress can contribute to elevated blood pressure, often leading to unhealthy coping mechanisms that further increase the risk.</p>
    </li>
    <li>
        <h2>Unhealthy Diet</h2>
        <p>A diet high in salt, saturated and trans fats, and low in fruits and vegetables can increase the risk of high blood pressure.</p>
    </li>
    <li>
        <h2>Sleep Apnea</h2>
        <p>Sleep apnea, characterized by interrupted breathing during sleep, is associated with an increased risk of high blood pressure.</p>
    </li>
    <li>
        <h2>Chronic Conditions</h2>
        <p>Certain chronic conditions like diabetes, kidney disease, and high cholesterol can heighten the risk of developing high blood pressure.</p>
    </li>
    <li>
        <h2>Additional Factors</h2>
        <p>Other factors, such as excessive alcohol consumption, hormonal imbalances, and medication side effects, can also influence blood pressure levels. It's crucial to be aware of these factors and take steps to address them for better cardiovascular health.</p>
