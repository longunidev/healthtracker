<h1>Different Types of Hypertension</h1>

<ul>
    <li>
        <h2>Overview</h2>
        <p>Did you know there are two main types of hypertension? Let's delve into primary hypertension and secondary hypertension, each with its unique causes.</p>
    </li>
    <li>
        <h2>Primary Hypertension</h2>
        <p>Primary hypertension is the most common form, characterized by a persistent increase in blood pressure unrelated to other medical conditions. While the exact cause remains elusive, lifestyle factors like unhealthy diets, lack of physical activity, and habits such as smoking and excessive alcohol consumption contribute to its development.</p>
        <p>As individuals age, blood pressure tends to rise, often requiring lifelong medication for management.</p>
    </li>
    <li>
        <h2>Secondary Hypertension</h2>
        <p>Constituting only 5 to 10 percent of cases, secondary hypertension is more prevalent in younger individuals. It can result from various factors, including certain medications, obstructive sleep apnea, kidney disease, adrenal gland tumors, thyroid problems, or blood vessel defects. Fortunately, managing the underlying cause or discontinuing specific medications can effectively control secondary hypertension.</p>
    </li>
    <li>
        <h2>Understanding the Differences</h2>
        <p>It's crucial to recognize the distinctions between primary and secondary hypertension. Primary hypertension is often a result of lifestyle factors, while secondary hypertension is linked to specific medical conditions. Regular check-ups and a holistic approach to health can contribute to better blood pressure management.</p>
    </li>
    <li>
        <h2>Additional Insights</h2>
        <p>Exploring lifestyle modifications, such as a heart-healthy diet, regular exercise, and stress management, can play a crucial role in preventing and managing hypertension. Regular health check-ups and monitoring blood pressure levels are essential components of a proactive approach to cardiovascular health.</p>
