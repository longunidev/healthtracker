<h1>Understanding Blood Pressure</h1>

<ul>
    <li>
        <h2>What is blood pressure?</h2>
        <p>Blood pressure refers to the pressure exerted by blood on the walls of arteries as the heart pumps it throughout the body. It serves as a vital indicator of overall health and can be influenced by factors such as age, genetics, lifestyle, and underlying medical conditions.</p>
    </li>
    <li>
        <h2>What do blood pressure numbers mean?</h2>
        <p>Blood pressure is measured in millimeters of mercury (mmHg) and is indicated by two numbers â€“ the systolic and diastolic pressures. The systolic pressure (top number) reflects artery pressure during heartbeats, while the diastolic pressure (bottom number) signifies pressure when the heart is at rest.</p>
    </li>
    <li>
        <h2>What are normal blood pressure numbers?</h2>
        <p>The typical blood pressure range is considered to be below 120/80 mmHg. This means the systolic pressure should be under 120 mmHg, and the diastolic pressure should be below 80 mmHg. However, a reading below 90/60 mmHg is considered low blood pressure and requires attention.</p>

        <h2>Understanding Hypertension (High Blood Pressure)</h2>
        <p>High blood pressure, also known as hypertension, occurs when the force of blood against artery walls is consistently elevated. This condition can result in artery damage and increase the risk of heart disease, stroke, and other health complications.</p>
        <p>Hypertension is typically diagnosed when blood pressure readings are consistently at or above 140/90 mmHg.</p>
        <p>Here is a breakdown of blood pressure categories:</p>
        <ul class="pressure-categories">
            <li><strong>Normal Blood Pressure:</strong> Below 120/80 mmHg</li>
            <li><strong>Elevated Blood Pressure:</strong> Systolic pressure between 120-129 mmHg and diastolic pressure below 80 mmHg</li>
            <li><strong>Stage 1 Hypertension:</strong> Systolic pressure between 130-139 mmHg or diastolic pressure between 80-89 mmHg</li>
            <li><strong>Stage 2 Hypertension:</strong> Systolic pressure of 140 mmHg or higher or diastolic pressure of 90 mmHg or higher</li>
            <li><strong>Hypertensive Crisis:</strong> Systolic pressure over 180 mmHg and/or diastolic pressure over 120 mmHg</li>
        </ul>
    </li>
</ul>
