    <h1>Common Heart Diseases</h1>

    <ul>
        <li>
            <h2>Congenital Heart Disease</h2>
            <p>Congenital heart disease, also known as congenital heart defect, is a type of heart issue present at
                birth.
                Common types include atypical heart valves, septal defects, and atresia. Some congenital heart defects
                may go undiagnosed as they may not exhibit any symptoms.</p>
        </li>

        <li>
            <h2>Coronary Artery Disease (CAD)</h2>
            <p>Coronary artery disease stands as the most prevalent heart condition. Individuals with CAD have narrow or
                blocked coronary arteries, potentially leading to chest pain, heart attacks, or strokes.
                Atherosclerosis,
                often referred to as hardening of the arteries, primarily causes CAD by reducing blood flow and limiting
                the supply of oxygen and nutrients to the heart.</p>
        </li>

        <li>
            <h2>Arrhythmia (abnormal heart rhythms)</h2>
            <p>Arrhythmia occurs when the heart muscle cannot regulate electrical impulses effectively, resulting in
                rapid (tachycardia), slow (bradycardia), or irregular heartbeats (atrial fibrillation).</p>
        </li>

        <li>
            <h2>Heart Valve Disease</h2>
            <p>Heart valve disease occurs when one or more heart valves fail to open and close properly, disrupting the
                flow of blood. This condition may be present at birth or caused by factors such as high blood pressure,
                CAD, heart infections, or a heart attack.</p>
        </li>

        <li>
            <h2>Dilated Cardiomyopathy</h2>
            <p>Dilated cardiomyopathy is a condition where the heart muscle becomes stretched, thickened, or stiff.
                Without proper treatment, the heart weakens over time, potentially leading to arrhythmia, blood clots,
                and heart failure. This condition is more prevalent among individuals aged 20 to 60, as reported by the
                American Heart Association.</p>
        </li>

        <li>
            <h2>Pericardial Disease</h2>
            <p>The pericardium, consisting of the visceral and parietal layers with a middle fluid layer, can be
                affected
                by pericardial disease. Pericarditis, inflammation of the pericardium, is a common condition,
                particularly observed in individuals undergoing open heart surgery.</p>
        </li>

        <li>
            <h2>Heart Failure</h2>
            <p>Heart failure occurs when the heart cannot effectively pump blood to meet the body's needs. Causes
                include
                untreated coronary artery disease, high blood pressure, and arrhythmias. Early treatment and lifestyle
                changes are crucial to manage heart failure, as it is not curable.</p>
