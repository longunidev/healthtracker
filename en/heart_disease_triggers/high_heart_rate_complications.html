    <h1>High Heart Rate Complications</h1>

    <ul>
      <li>
        <p>
          Your heart rate may occasionally exceed the normal range, especially
          during exercise, stress, or due to a related disease.
        </p>
      </li>

      <li>
        <p>
          However, if your resting heart rate consistently surpasses 100 beats
          per minute without psychological stress, it could indicate a serious
          heart condition known as tachycardia. This condition increases the
          risk of stroke, heart failure, sudden cardiac arrest, and even death.
        </p>

        <p>
          A study conducted by the Copenhagen Male Study in 1971, monitoring the
          health and resting heart rate of 3,000 middle-aged men for 16 years,
          revealed that every 10 to 22 increase in resting heart rate per minute
          raised the risk of death by 16%. For example, individuals with a
          resting heart rate over 90 beats per minute elevated their risk of
          death by 120% to 150%.
        </p>

        <p>
          In addition to the heightened risk of death, a high resting heart rate
          can lead to various complications. While some individuals with
          tachycardia may not experience symptoms, others may encounter
          complications triggered by a rapid heartbeat.
        </p>
      </li>

      <li>
        <h2>Complications of tachycardia:</h2>
        <ul class="normal-ul">
          <li>Fainting</li>
          <li>Dizziness</li>
          <li>Shortness of breath</li>
          <li>Fatigue</li>
          <li>Angina</li>
          <li>Heart palpitations</li>
          <li>Heart failure</li>
          <li>Stroke</li>
          <li>Blood clots</li>
          <li>Cardiac arrest</li>
          <li>Sudden death</li>
        </ul>

        <p>
          If you experience extreme pain or discomfort with your palpitations,
          seek emergency help immediately.
