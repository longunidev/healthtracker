    <h1>Understanding Diabetes Tests &amp; Diagnosis</h1>

    <ul>
      <li>
        <p>
          Diagnosing diabetes involves several tests, usually repeated on a
          second day for confirmation. Learn about the various diagnostic tests
          used to identify diabetes and prediabetes.
        </p>
      </li>

      <li>
        <h2>Glycated Hemoglobin (A1C) Test</h2>
        <p>
          The A1C test is a common method for diagnosing prediabetes and
          diabetes. It does not require fasting and provides a measurement of
          blood sugar attached to hemoglobin over two or three months. An A1C
          level of 6.5% or higher indicates diabetes, 5.7 to 6.4% suggests
          prediabetes, and under 5.7% is considered normal.
        </p>
      </li>

      <li>
        <h2>Fasting Plasma Sugar (FPG) Test</h2>
        <p>
          This test measures diabetes or prediabetes and requires fasting for at
          least 8 hours, offering optimal accuracy when conducted in the
          morning.
        </p>
      </li>

      <li>
        <h2>Random Blood Sugar (RPG) Test</h2>
        <p>
          Conducted at random times, this test diagnoses type 1 diabetes without
          overnight fasting. A blood sugar level of 200 mg/dL or higher
          indicates diabetes.
        </p>
      </li>

      <li>
        <h2>Oral Sugar Tolerance Test (OGTT)</h2>
        <p>
          After fasting overnight, this test involves drinking a
          sugar-containing liquid, with blood sugar levels checked every hour
          for 2 to 3 hours to assess prediabetes or diabetes.
        </p>
      </li>

      <li>
        <h2>Diabetes Diagnosis for Pregnant Women</h2>
        <p>
          Pregnant women undergo the oral sugar tolerance test and a sugar
          challenge test between the 24th and 28th weeks of pregnancy. The sugar
          challenge test, conducted without fasting, assesses blood sugar levels
          one hour after drinking a sugar-containing liquid. If results indicate
          high blood sugar (over 140 mg/dL), an OGTT is performed for a
          definitive diabetes diagnosis.
        </p>
      </li>

      <li>
        <h2>Additional Tests and Considerations</h2>
        <p>
          In addition to the mentioned tests, healthcare providers may recommend
          other assessments, such as:
        </p>
        <ul class="normal-ul">
          <li>
            <strong>Postprandial Blood Sugar Test:</strong> Measures blood sugar
            levels 1-2 hours after a meal.
          </li>
          <li>
            <strong>Continuous Glucose Monitoring (CGM):</strong> Involves
            wearing a device to monitor blood sugar levels throughout the day.
          </li>
          <li>
            <strong>Insulin Level Test:</strong> Checks insulin levels to assess
            how well the body is using insulin.
          </li>
        </ul>
        <p>
          It's important to note that accurate diagnosis and proper management
          of diabetes involve a comprehensive evaluation by healthcare
          professionals.
