    <h1>Low Blood Sugar</h1>

    <ul>
        <li>

            <p>Low blood sugar, or hypoglycemia, may not always exhibit symptoms and might not require immediate
                treatment.
                However,
                if left untreated and blood sugar drops significantly, it can pose a risk. Explore the information below
                to
                gain
                insights into low blood sugar and its management.</p>

        </li>

            <h2>Diagnosing Hypoglycemia</h2>

            <p>Recognizing hypoglycemia can be challenging as symptoms may not manifest until blood sugar drops below 55
                mg/dL
                (3
                mmol/L). To detect low blood sugar, a home blood sugar meter is essential. If the reading is under 70
                mg/dL
                (3.9
                mmol/L), it indicates low blood sugar.</p>

            <p>People with diabetes may experience hypoglycemia due to factors such as excessive insulin, skipped meals,
                or
                delayed
                eating after medication. Non-diabetics can also face low blood sugar, with reactive hypoglycemia
                occurring a
                few
                hours after eating, and fasting hypoglycemia linked to certain medications or underlying diseases.</p>

        </li>

        <li>

            <h2>Treating Hypoglycemia</h2>

            <p>When hypoglycemia occurs, it can be managed by consuming 15-20 grams of fast-acting carbohydrates, such
                as
                juice,
                hard candy, or sugar tablets. Check blood sugar levels after 15 minutes, and if it remains below 70
                mg/dL,
                repeat
                sugar intake at 15-minute intervals. Once blood sugar normalizes, consume a snack or meal for sustained
                stability.
            </p>

            <p>In severe cases, where hypoglycemia persists, seeking medical attention is crucial. Ambulance services
                may
                administer
                sugar injections or medications such as Baqsimi, Dasiglucagon, or Gvoke.</p>

            <p>If non-diabetic individuals frequently experience hypoglycemia, consulting a healthcare professional is
                advisable
                to
                identify potential causes like medications or tumors.</p>

        </li>

            <h2>First Aid for Hypoglycemia</h2>

            <p>Severe hypoglycemia, an emergency characterized by very low blood sugar, may occur in diabetics who skip
                meals,
                consume alcohol, or take excessive insulin. Recognize signs such as weakness, seizures, trembling,
                hunger,
                cold
                sweat, rapid pulse, and passing out.</p>

            <p>If the person is conscious:</p>
            <ul class="normal-ul">
                <li>Help them sit down and provide reassurance.</li>
                <li>Offer 15-20 grams of simple sugar (hard candy, raisins, honey, fruit juice, non-diet soda, or
                    jellybeans).
                </li>
                <li>Check blood sugar after 15 minutes and repeat sugar intake if needed until recovery or medical
                    assistance
                    arrives.</li>
            </ul>

            <p>If the person is unconscious:</p>
            <ul class="normal-ul">
                <li>Call for urgent medical assistance and place the person on their side.</li>
                <li>Do not allow the person to eat or drink anything.</li>
            </ul>

            <p>People with diabetes may encounter low blood sugar weekly, necessitating knowledge of identification and
                proper
                treatment for their well-being.</p>
        </li>
    </ul>
