    <h1>Hypertension: Types and Symptoms</h1>

    <ul>
      <li>
        <p>
          Delve into the world of blood pressure and the intricate workings of
          the cardiovascular system. Imagine the human cardiovascular system as
          a dynamic water circulatory system, where blood, like water, flows
          continuously, transporting oxygen and nutrients to organs and blood
          vessels.
        </p>

        <p>
          The heart serves as a relentless pump, propelling blood throughout the
          body's intricate network of vessels. As blood courses through, it
          exerts force against the vessel walls â€“ this force is known as blood
          pressure. Elasticity loss in blood vessels can hinder smooth blood
          flow, compelling the body to increase the force, leading to
          hypertension.

        <h2>Understanding Hypertension Types</h2>
        <p>
          Primary hypertension, the most common type, sees blood pressure rise
          with age, requiring lifelong medication for control. On the other
          hand, secondary hypertension stems from various conditions or
          medications and can improve when the underlying cause is addressed.

        <h2>Understanding Hypertension Symptoms</h2>

        <p>
          While often referred to as the "silent killer," hypertension may
          reveal symptoms in severe cases. Recognize these signs and seek
          immediate medical attention:
        </p>

        <ul class="normal-ul">
          <li>
            <h3>Headache</h3>
            <p>
              A pulsating headache on both sides of the head may signal a
              hypertensive emergency, potentially damaging blood vessels in the
              brain.
            </p>
          </li>
          <li>
            <h3>Dizziness</h3>
            <p>
              Sudden dizziness or loss of balance could be a sign of severe high
              blood pressure, a major contributor to stroke.
            </p>
          </li>
          <li>
            <h3>Nausea</h3>
            <p>
              Experiencing sudden nausea and loss of appetite may indicate a
              hypertensive crisis, often accompanied by dizziness.
            </p>
          </li>
          <li>
            <h3>Shortness of Breath</h3>
            <p>
              High blood pressure's impact on heart and lung function may lead
              to noticeable shortness of breath, especially during exercise.
            </p>
          </li>
          <li>
            <h3>Chest Pain</h3>
            <p>
              Hypertension poses a significant risk for heart attack and heart
              failure, potentially causing chest pain or angina.
            </p>
          </li>
          <li>
            <h3>Blurred Vision</h3>
            <p>
              Dangerously high blood pressure can damage small vessels in the
              eyes, causing blurred vision or even loss of vision.
            </p>
          </li>
          <li>
            <h3>Nosebleed</h3>
            <p>
              While uncommon, extremely high blood pressure may lead to
              nosebleeds, signifying vessel damage and warranting immediate
              medical attention.
            </p>
