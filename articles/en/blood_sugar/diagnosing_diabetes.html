    <h1>Diagnosing Diabetes</h1>

    <ul>
      <li>
        <h2>Methods of Diagnosis</h2>
        <p>
          Diagnosing diabetes involves various methods, each typically requiring
          confirmation on a separate day. Learn about the tests used to identify
          diabetes and prediabetes.
        </p>
      </li>

      <li>
        <h2>Glycated Hemoglobin (A1C) Test</h2>
        <p>
          The A1C test is a common diagnostic tool for prediabetes and diabetes.
          This test, done without fasting, measures the percentage of blood
          sugar attached to hemoglobin over two or three months, providing an
          average blood sugar level.
        </p>
        <ul class="normal-ul">
          <li>If A1C is 6.5% or higher: Indicates diabetes</li>
          <li>If A1C is 5.7 to 6.4%: Indicates prediabetes</li>
          <li>If A1C is under 5.7%: Indicates normal blood sugar level</li>
        </ul>
      </li>

      <li>
        <h2>Fasting Plasma Sugar (FPG) Test</h2>
        <p>
          This test, requiring at least 8 hours of fasting, measures blood sugar
          levels in the morning. It provides accurate results for diagnosing
          diabetes or prediabetes.
        </p>
      </li>

      <li>
        <h2>Random Blood Sugar (RPG) Test</h2>
        <p>
          A non-fasting test conducted at any time, the RPG test checks blood
          sugar levels. Results of 200 mg/dL or higher may indicate diabetes.
        </p>
      </li>

      <li>
        <h2>Oral Sugar Tolerance Test (OGTT)</h2>
        <p>
          For this test, fasting is required, and a sugar-containing liquid is
          consumed. Blood sugar levels are tested every hour for 2 to 3 hours to
          determine prediabetes or diabetes.
        </p>
      </li>

      <li>
        <h2>Diagnosis for Pregnant Women</h2>
        <p>
          Pregnant women undergo specific tests, primarily the oral sugar
          tolerance test and sugar challenge test, between the 24th and 28th
          weeks of pregnancy.
        </p>
        <ul class="normal-ul">
          <li>
            Sugar Challenge Test: Non-fasting test, checks blood sugar one hour
            after consuming a sugar-containing liquid.
          </li>
          <li>
            Oral Sugar Tolerance Test (OGTT): Follows if the sugar challenge
            test result is high (over 140 mg/dL), confirming diabetes during
            pregnancy.
          </li>
        </ul>
      </li>

        <h2>Understanding Blood Sugar Ranges</h2>
        <p>
          Knowing the normal ranges of blood sugar is essential for managing
          diabetes. Blood sugar levels vary before and after meals, and
          age-specific ranges are observed.
        </p>
      </li>

      <li>
        <h2>Normal Ranges for Adults</h2>
        <p>
          As per diabetes.co.uk and the American Diabetes Association, adults
          without diabetes exhibit normal blood sugar levels:
        </p>
        <ul class="normal-ul">
          <li>Before meals or fasting: 4.0 to 5.4 mmol/L (72 to 99 mg/dL)</li>
          <li>
            At least 90 minutes after eating: Under 7.8 mmol/L (140 mg/dL)
          </li>
        </ul>
      </li>

      <li>
        <h2>Normal Ranges for Children</h2>
        <p>Children's blood sugar levels vary by age:</p>
        <ul class="normal-ul">
          <li>
            Children under 6: 4.5 to 11.1 mmol/L (80 to 200 mg/dL) each day
          </li>
          <li>
            Children between 6 and 12: Fasting 4.5 to 10 mmol/L (80 to 180
            mg/dL), Before meals 5 to 10 mmol/L (90 to 180 mg/dL), One to two
            hours after meals under 7.8 mmol/L (140 mg/dL)
          </li>
          <li>
            Teens from 13 to 19: Fasting between 3.9 and 8.3 mmol/L (70 to 150
            mg/dL), Before meals from 5 to 7.2 mmol/L (90 to 130 mg/dL), One to
            two hours after meals under 7.8 mmol/L (140 mg/dL)
          </li>
        </ul>
      </li>

      <li>
        <h2>Hypoglycemia Awareness</h2>
        <p>
          Aside from normal and diabetic ranges, understanding hypoglycemia is
          crucial. Hypoglycemia occurs when blood sugar drops below 3.89 mmol/L
          (70 mg/dL), with symptoms appearing below 3 mmol/L (55 mg/dL).
