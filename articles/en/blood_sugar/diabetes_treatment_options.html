    <h1>Exploring Diabetes Treatment</h1>

    <ul>
      <li>
        <h2>Treatment of Diabetes</h2>
        <p>
          When diabetes develops, various medications are available for
          treatment. The type of drugs prescribed depends on the specific type
          of diabetes an individual has. This article provides insights into the
          treatment options for both type 1 and type 2 diabetes.
        </p>

        <h2>Medications For Type 1 Diabetes: Insulin</h2>
        <p>
          Insulin is the most common therapy for treating type 1 diabetes. It
          works by replacing the insulin that the body cannot produce. Diabetics
          need to inject insulin under the skin to enter the bloodstream, as
          oral intake is not feasible due to breakdown during digestion.
        </p>
        <p><strong>Different types of insulin include:</strong></p>
        <ul class="normal-ul">
          <li>
            Rapid-acting insulin: Starts working in about 15 minutes, peaks
            after an hour, and lasts for 2 to 4 hours.
          </li>
          <li>
            Short-acting insulin: Works within 30 minutes, peaks in 2 to 3
            hours, and lasts for 3 to 6 hours.
          </li>
          <li>
            Intermediate-acting insulin: Starts working 2 to 4 hours after
            injection, peaks 4 to 12 hours after injection, with effects lasting
            12 to 18 hours.
          </li>
          <li>
            Long-acting insulin: Reaches the bloodstream several hours after
            injection, providing a continuous, non-peaking effect for 24 hours
            or longer.
          </li>
        </ul>
        <p>
          Insulin may also be prescribed for gestational diabetes and used in
          combination with other oral drugs for type 2 diabetes.
        </p>
      </li>

      <li>
        <h2>Oral Medicines For Type 2 Diabetes</h2>
        <p>
          <strong>Metformin:</strong> Belonging to the biguanide class,
          Metformin is a commonly used first-line treatment for type 2 diabetes.
          It reduces liver-produced sugar and enhances insulin utilization.
          Diarrhea may occur as a side effect.
        </p>
        <p>
          <strong>Sulphonylureas:</strong> Includes glipizide, glimepiride, and
          glyburide, stimulating insulin release from the pancreas. It can be
          used alone or in combination with Metformin.
        </p>
        <p><strong>Other medicines:</strong></p>
        <ul class="normal-ul">
          <li>
            <strong>Gliptins:</strong> Accelerate insulin absorption into the
            bloodstream.
          </li>
          <li>
            <strong>Glitazones:</strong> Facilitate the body's insulin
            utilization.
          </li>
          <li>
            <strong>Acarbose:</strong> Prevents the conversion of ingested
            carbohydrates into sugar.
          </li>
          <li>
            <strong>GLP-1 analogues (exenatide):</strong> Accelerate insulin
            absorption into the bloodstream.
          </li>
          <li>
            <strong>SGLT2 inhibitors:</strong> Used in combination with other
            drugs.
          </li>
        </ul>

        <p>
          Understanding the medications prescribed can provide valuable insights
          into managing your condition.
