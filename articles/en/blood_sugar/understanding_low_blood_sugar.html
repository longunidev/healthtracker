    <h1>Understanding Low Blood Sugar</h1>

    <ul>
      <li>
        <p>
          Low blood sugar, also known as hypoglycemia, may not always exhibit
          symptoms, but it can pose risks if not addressed. This article
          provides insights into low blood sugar, its diagnosis, and ways to
          manage this condition effectively.
        </p>
      </li>

      <li>
        <h2>Diagnosing Hypoglycemia</h2>
        <p>
          Determining hypoglycemia can be challenging as symptoms may not appear
          until blood sugar levels drop below 55 mg/dL (3 mmol/L). To identify
          low blood sugar, using a home blood sugar meter is essential. If the
          meter indicates a level below 70 mg/dL (3.9 mmol/L), it signifies low
          blood sugar. Individuals with diabetes may experience hypoglycemia due
          to factors such as excessive insulin, missed meals, or delayed eating
          after medication. Non-diabetics can also face low blood sugar, with
          reactive hypoglycemia occurring a few hours after eating, and fasting
          hypoglycemia linked to certain medications or diseases.
        </p>
      </li>

      <li>
        <h2>Treating Hypoglycemia</h2>
        <p>
          When hypoglycemia occurs, prompt treatment is crucial. Consuming 15-20
          grams of fast-acting carbohydrates, such as juice, hard candy, or
          sugar tablets, can help raise blood sugar levels. Recheck blood sugar
          after 15 minutes, and if it remains below 70 mg/dL, continue the
          carbohydrate intake in 15-minute intervals. Once blood sugar
          normalizes, consuming a snack or meal helps stabilize blood sugar
          levels and replenish glycogen stores. Severe hypoglycemia may require
          medical attention, including the administration of sugar injections
          and medications like Baqsimi, Dasiglucagon, or Gvoke.
        </p>
      </li>

      <li>
        <h2>First Aid for Hypoglycemia Emergency</h2>
        <p>
          Severe hypoglycemia, characterized by symptoms like weakness,
          seizures, trembling, hunger, cold sweat, rapid pulse, and passing out,
          requires immediate action. If the person is conscious:
        </p>
        <ul class="normal-ul">
          <li>Help them sit down and reassure them.</li>
          <li>
            Provide 15-20 grams of simple sugar, such as hard candy, raisins,
            honey, fruit juice, non-diet soda, or jellybeans.
          </li>
          <li>
            Check blood sugar after 15 minutes and repeat sugar intake if levels
            remain below 70 mg/dL.
          </li>
        </ul>

        <p>If the person is unconscious:</p>
        <ul class="normal-ul">
          <li>Call for urgent medical assistance.</li>
          <li>Place the person on their side.</li>
          <li>Do not allow them to eat or drink anything.</li>
        </ul>

        <p>
          People with diabetes may encounter low blood sugar regularly, even
          with careful blood sugar management. Understanding how to recognize
          and address it is crucial for overall health.
