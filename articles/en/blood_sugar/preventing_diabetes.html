    <h1>Preventing Diabetes</h1>

    <ul>
      <li>
        <h2>Type 1 Diabetes and Prevention</h2>
        <p>
          Type 1 diabetes is inherently unavoidable. However, there's
          encouraging news for individuals with prediabetes, type 2 diabetes,
          and gestational diabetes. Here are actionable steps to delay or
          prevent these conditions.
        </p>
      </li>

      <li>
        <h2>Healthy Food Choices</h2>
        <p>
          Opt for foods lower in calories and fats while rich in fiber to
          effectively manage blood sugar levels. This approach reduces daily
          calorie intake and aids in weight loss. Include fruits, vegetables,
          whole grains, and seafood in your diet, and opt for water over sugary
          beverages. Avoid saturated fats like butter, animal fat, coconut oil,
          or palm oil. Consume small, balanced meals throughout the day.
        </p>
      </li>

      <li>
        <h2>Regular Exercise</h2>
        <p>
          Initiate a gradual habit of engaging in at least 30 minutes of
          physical activity five days a week. Opt for moderate aerobic exercises
          such as biking, brisk walking, hiking, and more to promote overall
          well-being.
        </p>
      </li>

      <li>
        <h2>Weight Management</h2>
        <p>
          Use a BMI Calculator to determine your weight range. If overweight,
          shedding 7% of your body weight can significantly impact diabetes
          prevention. For individuals with gestational diabetes, consult a
          healthcare professional for guidance on maintaining a healthy weight
          during pregnancy.
        </p>
      </li>

      <li>
        <h2>Smoking Cessation</h2>
        <p>
          Smoking is linked to an increased risk of diabetes development. To
          prevent diabetes, steer clear of tobacco products and embrace a
          smoke-free lifestyle.
        </p>
      </li>

      <li>
        <h2>Blood Pressure Control</h2>
        <p>
          Individuals with high blood pressure face a higher risk of developing
          type 2 diabetes. Hence, normal blood pressure is crucial in preventing
          diabetes, complementing the control of blood sugar levels.
        </p>
        <p>
          Adopting a healthy lifestyle—comprising nutritious eating, regular
          exercise, maintaining a healthy weight, moderate alcohol consumption,
          and limited salt intake—contributes to effective blood pressure
          control. This holistic approach not only safeguards against high blood
          pressure but also helps manage blood sugar levels.

          Beyond preventing diabetes, embracing a healthy lifestyle positively
          influences various aspects of well-being. Regular health check-ups and
