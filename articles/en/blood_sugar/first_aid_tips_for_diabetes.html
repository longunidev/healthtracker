        <h2>Understanding Diabetic Emergencies</h2>
        <p>
          When individuals experience a diabetic emergency due to either
          excessively high or low blood sugar levels, knowing how to respond is
          crucial. This guide provides first aid tips to assist loved ones or

        <h2>Hyperglycemia: Recognizing the Signs</h2>
        <p>
          Hyperglycemia, characterized by significantly high blood sugar levels,
          can pose a life-threatening situation if not controlled. Potential
          causes include pancreatic infections, insufficient insulin, or
          excessive intake of sugary and starchy foods. Recognize signs such as
          excessive thirst, dry skin, shortness of breath, fruity breath odor,
          abdominal pain, nausea or vomiting, and a rapid loss of consciousness
          if untreated.

        <h2>First Aid Measures</h2>
        <p>
          If someone with diabetes displays symptoms of hyperglycemia, take the
          following first aid steps:
        </p>
        <ul class="normal-ul">
          <li>Call emergency medical assistance for an ambulance.</li>
          <li>
            Check the person's blood sugar and assess their level of response.
          </li>
          <li>
            If conscious, assist in administering insulin or taking prescribed
            medications.
          </li>
          <li>
            If unconscious, check and maintain an open airway, and provide
            sugar-free fluids to alleviate thirst.
          </li>
        </ul>
        <p>
          These measures, when followed systematically, can significantly
          improve the person's condition during a hyperglycemic crisis.
