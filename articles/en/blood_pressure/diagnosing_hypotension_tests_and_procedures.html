    <h1>Understanding and Diagnosing Hypotension</h1>

    <ul>
      <li>
        <h2>Blood Test for Comprehensive Insight</h2>
        <p>
          If you suspect chronic hypotension, comprehensive blood tests are
          crucial. These tests measure blood sugar levels and red blood cell
          count to provide insights into your blood health and identify signs of
          hypotension.
        </p>
      </li>
      <li>
        <h2>Tilt Table Test for Orthostatic Hypotension</h2>
        <p>
          A tilt table test is a prevalent method for diagnosing orthostatic
          hypotension. During the test, your heart rate, blood pressure, and
          symptoms are monitored as the table is gradually tilted upright. A
          drop of 20mmHg in systolic or 10mmHg in diastolic below the baseline
          indicates orthostatic hypotension.
        </p>
        <p>
          If symptoms occur during the test, immediate return to a supine
          position is necessary.
        </p>

        <h2>Electrocardiogram (ECG) for Heart Screening</h2>
        <p>
          To screen for heart issues causing blood pressure drops, an
          electrocardiogram (ECG) is essential. This non-invasive procedure uses
          electrodes on your chest, arms, and legs to detect the heart's
          electrical signals. ECG can identify irregular heart rhythms,
          structural issues, and other cardiac conditions.
        </p>
      </li>

        <h2>Additional Considerations</h2>
        <p>
          For a more comprehensive assessment, your healthcare provider may
          combine these tests with a physical examination, medical history
          review, and ambulatory monitoring to capture blood pressure variations
          throughout the day.
